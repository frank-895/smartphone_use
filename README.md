Many investigations have explored the effect of technology in general on wellbeing.​
However, some studies have also shown interesting differences between ‘passive’ and ‘interactive’ screen use. ​
For example, Twenge, Martin & Spitzberg in their report Trends in US Adolescents’ Media Use (2019)​
This investigation goes a step further, exploring not just ‘interactive’ screen use but smartphone use in particular. 

Null HYPOTHESIS:
The mean self-reported wellbeing score of low smartphone users is the same as that of high smartphone users. 

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS​
The mean self-reported wellbeing score of low smartphone users is higher than that of high smartphone users. 

The investigation employs 2 datasets - one containing the technology use of adolescents and one containing their wellbeing scores across multiple metrics.

The investigation initially uses t-testing and u-testing to determine if smartphone use proportion (i.e., the percentage of time a person spends on their smartphone compared to their total technology time) correlates with wellbeing. After confirming this is the case, the investigation uses u-testing on each wellbeing metric to determine if 'high' smartphone users score worse across all metrics. The results are displayed to the screen with interesting determinations about smartphone use proportion.

************* Results using avg wellbeing scores​ *********************
T-TEST RESULT​
P-value is 0.017 which is sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. ​
This suggests low proportion smartphone users have better overall wellbeing than high proportion smartphone users.

U-TEST RESULT​
P-value is 0.025 which is sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. ​
This suggests low proportion smartphone users have better overall wellbeing than high proportion smartphone users.​

************* Do high smartphone users have lower scores across all metrics?​ *********************
A u-test was conducted for each individual metric comparing high and low smartphone users. ​
Any metric that gained a p-value that was above 0.05 was highlighted.​
There is insufficient evidence that low smartphone users have higher scores in the:​
Interested in other people metric​
Feeling close to other people metric​
In fact, the p-value for these metrics was ~1.0 suggesting that high smartphone users score higher than low smartphone users in these areas. 

LIMITATIONS
- The testing has only experimented with ’extreme’ smartphone users – people who use their phone a lot or very little.​
- The investigation does not provide insight into the wellbeing vs amount of time spent on smartphone. It is possible a 'high' smartphone user only uses their phone for 5 minutes a day, but uses no other technology types. ​
- Other usual limitations from data analysis: risk of poor data collection, errors in data entry, especially as the data analyst did not collect the data.
- This investigation initially used t-testing, which likely produced inaccurate p-values as the wellbeing data is ordinal. This was rectified by implementing a Mann-Whitney U-test as well, which is appropriate for ordinal data.
