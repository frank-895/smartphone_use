***Investigation of Smartphone Use and Wellbeing in Adolescents***

This investigation explores the relationship between smartphone usage and wellbeing in adolescents, building upon previous research into technology's effects on mental health. While many studies have examined general technology use, this study distinguishes between passive and interactive screen time, focusing specifically on smartphone usage as a unique form of interactive technology.

The study analyzes two datasets:
- Adolescent technology usage (including smartphone proportion of total tech time).
- Wellbeing scores across multiple metrics, self-reported by adolescents.

**Hypotheses**

- Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean self-reported wellbeing score of low smartphone users is the same as that of high smartphone users.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean self-reported wellbeing score of low smartphone users is higher than that of high smartphone users.

**Methodology**

The investigation employs both t-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests to examine the correlation between smartphone use and wellbeing.

*T-Testing & U-Testing:*
- Initial tests were conducted to determine if the smartphone use proportion (i.e., the percentage of time spent on smartphones compared to total technology time) correlates with self-reported wellbeing.
- After confirming a correlation, U-tests were used to assess whether high smartphone users scored worse across all wellbeing metrics compared to low smartphone users.
*Wellbeing Metrics:*
- Various metrics of wellbeing were analyzed using U-tests as well, to analyse the performance of high smartphone users in detail. 

**Results**

*Overall Wellbeing (Average Scores)*

T-Test Result:
P-value = 0.017, sufficient to reject the null hypothesis.
Conclusion: Low smartphone users report better overall wellbeing than high smartphone users.

U-Test Result:
P-value = 0.025, again sufficient to reject the null hypothesis.
Conclusion: Low smartphone users have better overall wellbeing than high smartphone users.

*Wellbeing Across Individual Metrics*

A Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted for each individual wellbeing metric. The results indicate that:

For most metrics, low smartphone users had higher wellbeing scores.
However, there were two metrics where no significant difference was found, and in fact, high smartphone users performed better:

- Interested in Other People (P-value ≈ 1.0)
- Feeling Close to Other People (P-value ≈ 1.0)

These results suggest that, in these two areas, high smartphone users may report better social connectivity than low smartphone users.

**Limitations**

Several limitations should be noted for this investigation:

- Extreme User Focus: The study only compares extreme users (those who use smartphones a lot vs. very little). It does not account for moderate users or different patterns of smartphone use.
- Smartphone Use Proportion: The study measures the proportion of total technology time spent on smartphones, not the absolute time. A "high smartphone user" might spend only 5 minutes on their phone but no time on other devices.
- Data Quality: Common data analysis limitations apply, including potential issues with data collection and entry errors, as the analyst did not collect the data directly.
- Statistical Testing Concerns: Initial tests used t-testing, which may not be appropriate for ordinal data like self-reported wellbeing scores. To correct this, the investigation shifted to the Mann-Whitney U-test, which is more suitable for this type of data.

**Conclusion**

This study provides evidence that low smartphone users generally report better overall wellbeing than high smartphone users. However, interesting exceptions exist in the social aspects of wellbeing, where high smartphone users may feel more connected to others.

The investigation also highlights the need for future research to examine moderate smartphone users, explore absolute time spent on smartphones, and refine data collection methods to improve accuracy.
